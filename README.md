# About The Project
This is a project based in Desafios HTML(HTML Challenges) from Rocketseat's discover course challenges.

It's the fifth challenge of Desafios HTML(HTML Challenges) called Blog Post.

The first image is from random unsplash images 300x300.
The second image it's my photo from my local laptop but it's not in my repository, so you'll need to put your own photo or another image in your project.

The contacts in contact.html file aren't real.
